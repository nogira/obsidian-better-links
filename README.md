## Obsidian link formater

Plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).

1. Copy url (e.g. `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdZZpaB2kDM`).
2. Use hotkey to trigger the `Link formatter: Link format` command.
3. Output: `ðŸ“¹ [Elon Musk talks Twitter, Tesla and how his brain works â€” live at TED2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdZZpaB2kDM)`

That simple.

Note: It can take a few seconds to load the output. So you're not waiting for it to load if the code fails for some reason, a message will pop-up in the top right of obsidian if the code fails.
