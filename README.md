  Obsidian better links
</h1>


Plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). Aims to automate linking to webpages and their content (there was a lot of unnecessary repetition).

## 1. Link formatting
1. Copy url (e.g. `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdZZpaB2kDM`).
2. Use hotkey to trigger the `Link formatter: Link format` command.
3. Output: `📹 [Elon Musk talks Twitter, Tesla and how his brain works — live at TED2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdZZpaB2kDM)`

_Note_: It can take a few seconds to load the output. A message will pop-up in the top right of obsidian if the code fails to format the link. This prevents you from waiting unnecessarily for an output that never comes.

#### Formatted link examples:

- 📹 [How to OVER Engineer a Website // What is a Tech Stack?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sxxw3qtb3_g)

- 📰 [Svelte vs React: Ending the Debate](http://web.archive.org/web/20211015215334/https://massivepixel.io/blog/svelte-vs-react/)

- 💬 [1000 consecutive days of using Anki to study advanced organic chemistry (among other things!)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210828162032/https://www.reddit.com/r/Anki/comments/om9zo6/1000_consecutive_days_of_using_anki_to_study/)

- 🔬 [Improving Students’ Learning With Effective Learning Techniques: Promising Directions From Cognitive and Educational Psychology](https://sci-hub.se/10.1177/1529100612453266)

_(Supports twitter threads too as long as they're not so long they have a "show more" button)_

## 2. Use archived version of url to prevent deadlinks

You copy a url, but the url used in the formatted link contains an an archived url instead:
- Copy: https://realpython.com/python-matplotlib-guide/
- Used: https://web.archive.org/web/20220303135642/https://realpython.com/python-matplotlib-guide/


## 3. Multi-paragraph quoting

Usually when you paste multi-paragraph text on a `> `, the first paragraph has the quote, and the quote's indentation, but every paragraph after that have no `> `, nor indentation. This plugin automatically adds it when pasting.
